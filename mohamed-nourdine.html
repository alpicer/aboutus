        			My name is Mohamed Nourdine<br> I am a computer engineering student at Selcuk University in Konya. I am from Cameroon more precisely from Foumban. I love technology and everything that has to do with Programming. For this reason, I decided to dive and hunt for knowledge in this field. I am at the pick of my training in my university. I am very optimistic that everything will go on very smoothly till i graduate and start my new life.
